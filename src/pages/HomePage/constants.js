          "OMG my daughter came home with these donuts & they were DELICIOUS!!! BEST I've ever tasted (& I'm fussy when it comes to donuts). Favourites out of 4 were Smores & Caramilk. Wouldn't mind trying other flavours. They look yummy! ðŸ˜Š",

          "Amazing donuts (the best in Auckland hands down) and super friendly team serving the goods! They even do vegan ones as specials every now and again, which is great if you are dairy free. Annoyingly always open when I head past as I canâ€™t resist stopping!",

          "Iâ€™ve been a long time customer at Doe- in their short but delicious history anyway. Have watched the product line grow and tasted most of everything theyâ€™ve put out. The girls never disappoint. Donuts are always so light and fluffy and the quality of fillings are up there with most gourmet restaurants Iâ€™ve eaten at. You gotta give this place a go!",

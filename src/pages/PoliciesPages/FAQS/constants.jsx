      We aim to complete all deliveries between 9am to 3pm. If you require your
      donuts to be delivered at a specific time, please leave us a note or email

      &nbsp; It&apos;s crucial to have someone available at the delivery address
      as we prioritize serving fresh donuts. In case no one is present,
      we&apos;ll contact you by phone to notify you of the arrival, and from
      that point on, the responsibility shifts to you. Remember, it&apos;s a
      race against potential ants to enjoy your delicious donuts

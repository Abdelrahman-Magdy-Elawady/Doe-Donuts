    "DOE DONUTS TERMS & CONDITIONS, CANCELLATIONS & REFUND POLICY",
    "All cancellations are subject to the owner's discretion. Our products are made using high-quality ingredients sourced from New Zealand. Each of our products is hand-made individually by us, based on your order and the details agreed upon in the order confirmation/invoice. Allergens All our products may contain or come into contact with peanuts, tree nuts, soybean derivatives, eggs, wheat gluten, milk, and other allergens. Online Orders All online orders must be paid in full before pick up/delivery, unless otherwise arranged. For in-store pickup or delivery, payment is made online at the time of placing the order on our website, www.doe.co.nz. Your order is confirmed when you receive an order confirmation with the date and time you have selected for in-store pickup or delivery. DOE Donuts will not provide refunds for late pick ups or no-shows. If you are experiencing any issues or are running late and are unable to contact us, you will not be refunded, and we cannot guarantee that your product will be fresh. We do not offer refunds for orders canceled within 24 hours of the order date. If you contact us successfully 24 hours prior to the date you have selected for your order, we are happy to refund you. The reason for this policy is that we must order ingredients or create parts of your product in advance, in addition to the labor that has already been expended in preparing any order. Our booking calendar fills up quickly, and orders are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. If you cancel your order within 24 hours of the date you have selected for in-store pickup or delivery, this takes up production time that could have otherwise been given to another customer. Once the customer has accepted the order upon delivery to the address provided, we are not liable for any damages. If we have delivered to an incorrect address that was on the order, we are happy to redeliver the donuts to the correct address or give a refund. If you have provided an incorrect address on your order, and we have delivered to that address, we will not provide a refund. If we discover that you have provided an incorrect address upon delivery, we will attempt to contact you to organize a redelivery, but there may be an additional charge for this service. If we are unable to contact you on the day of delivery regarding an incorrect address, we will not provide a refund. Bespoke Orders All bespoke orders must be paid in full before pick up/delivery, unless otherwise arranged. Any bespoke donut/product orders for an event have the potential to melt or deform due to weather changes. We are not liable for any replacement donuts once they have been delivered or picked up. We can provide storage instructions on request. Once the donuts have been picked up by you or a designated party and removed from our premises, they are considered accepted. Refunds requested due to decorating style will not be honored. If you are unhappy with the appearance of your order upon pickup, we can redecorate or make changes accordingly. We can provide a full refund if we retain the donuts. Refunds requested due to the quality of flavor will only be determined at the discretion of our staff, based upon the returned donuts/products. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a refund for any donuts that have been consumed. DOE Donuts will not provide refunds for late pickups or no-shows. A pickup time will be arranged at the time of booking. If you experience any issues or are running late and are unable to contact us, you will not be refunded, and we cannot guarantee that your product will be fresh. Please order these products at your own risk. In any such event as a natural disaster, pandemic or large scale situation beyond our control, refunds will not be provided for any deposits, part or full payments. We only give refunds in accordance with refund policies stated above. The policy is valid from 1st October 2020 and onwards and is subject to change at any time.",
